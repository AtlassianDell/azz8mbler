# Azz8mbler - Z80 Assembler
To assemble, use
```python main.py <infile> -o <outfile>```
To get plaintext hexadecimal (to enter on a calculator or such), use the -t flag.
Doesn't include including (yet), hang tight. All directives are not prefixed. In addition, unlike 99% of all other assemblers (main reason as to why I made this)
Currently TUI but I'll add GUI in the short future. It uses essentially the same syntax as all other assemblers (as provided by https://www.zilog.com/docs/z80/um0080.pdf)
There's no executable but I'll get Cython working soon (if not that, PyInstaller).
